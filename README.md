# API Testing Project – Trello REST API

##  Description
This is a pet project for practicing API testing using Trello's real REST API. I tested how to create, get, and delete a Trello board using Postman.

##  Tools
- Postman
- Trello Developer API
- JSON
- GitHub

##  Authorization
To send requests to Trello API, you need an `API Key` and `Token`.  
How to get them: [Trello API Authorization Guide](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/authorization/)
